# ZKorum - Democratize Democracy

**ZKorum (ZK + Forum)** is dedicated to developing open-source solutions and products to **rehumanize** and **depolarize** the online social landscape.

At ZKorum, we are building a safe and open digital space where we are in control of our identities and data, free to express our opinions, and encouraged to think critically and constructively.

Our technologies:
- **Zero Knowledge Proof cryptography (ZK)** to ensure user privacy and data trustworthiness
- **Trust-minimized infrastructure** to provide auditable moderation (Funded by the European Union under the [NGI Trustchain project](https://trustchain.ngi.eu/))
- **Bridging based ranking** algorithm to identify and promote voices that bridge divides (as opposed to engagement based algorithms known to fuel polarizations)

Our core product:

- [Agora Citizen Network](https://agoracitizen.network/): a social network designed for societal debates. Users are verified by ZK Proof of Passport, or Verifiable Credentials.

## Detailed solution

**Agora** is a Digital Democracy platfrom where communities and verified members can create and participate in anonymous polls and Wikisurveys. On reaching the  Progressive Web App (PWA), anyone can browse the existing public surveys and their results. For example, a public poll asking European residents from 18 to 60 years old if they will choose an Electric Vehicle over a gas one. By default, surveys are publicly visible. Participating in surveys is restricted to users who can prove they hold the right credentials (eligibility). Eligibility is verified in a privacy-preserving way using zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) of users’ Anonymous Credentials (Dock’s BBS+ W3C Verifiable Credentials).
