# ZKorum - Democratize Democracy

**ZKorum (ZK + Forum)** is dedicated to developing open-source solutions and products to **rehumanize** and **depolarize** the online social landscape.

We are building safe and open digital spaces where we are in control of our identities and data, free to express and exchange our opinions, and encouraged to think critically and constructively.

Our core product:

- [Agora Citizen Network](https://github.com/zkorum/agora)/): a social network designed for societal debates.

Our technologies:
- **Zero Knowledge Proof cryptography (ZK)** to ensure user privacy and data trustworthiness
- **Trust-minimized infrastructure** to provide auditable moderation (Funded by the European Union under the [NGI Trustchain project](https://trustchain.ngi.eu/))
- **Bridging based ranking** algorithm to identify and promote voices that bridge divides (as opposed to engagement based algorithms known to fuel polarizations)
